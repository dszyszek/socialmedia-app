- Express


## Features
Ok, so Socialyze is a normal, full-fledged social media app. What can you do here? Create a profile and check it out! <br>
To create an account just click on 'Sign up' button. Then pass name, email and password and here you are, a newly created account is all set up. One could think - are my credentials save in your DB? Of course yes! Password are encrypted with Blowfish algorithm, so don't you worry! <br>
Ok, when you log in, next step you should make is create your very own profile. There will be plenty of input fields, so take a minute to fill everything up. <br>
When you create your profile, then just add the experience and education you gained, and everything's ready! <br>
From now you can see your profile, share it, post something in Feed section, react on someones posts, check other users profiles and... well that's all for now. But!<br>
There are many plans for the future to improve app (you can see them in #Future section), so stay tuned!

## Future 

I'm looking forward to create some features that will improve UX and UI! Frist of all: chat! Second - posibility to add your own image as the avatar (and so app doesn't use gravatar anymore). Last (but not least) verification email when signing in.
